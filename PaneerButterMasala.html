    <h3>Paneer Butter Masala</h3>
    <p>Paneer is the key and primary ingredient for this recipe. It has to be fresh moist and soft for an authentic and tasty gravy. Avoid using store-bought paneer and use homemade for best results.</p><br>
    <h3>BALANCED TASTE</h3>
    <p>The recipe is known for its mild balanced flavors. Particularly it offers sweet, spicy, and savory curry with the richness and creaminess of paneer and cooking cream.</p><br>
    <h3>BALANCED TASTE</h3>
    <p>The texture and consistency of the gravy base is key for the curry. It has to be silky smooth so ground it to very smooth with a bright yellow colour.</p><br>
    <h3>CREAM VS. YOGHURT</h3>
    <p>The consistency of the gravy is achieved smoothly by adding cream or yogurt. Both help to achieve a rich and creamy consistency, but cream is a much better option as yogurt may introduce a sour taste to the curry.</p><br>
    <h3>EXPERIMENT</h3>
    <p>The recipe can be easily experimented or extended to add other veggies or primary ingredients. Paneer can be replaced with mushrooms, tofu, mixed veggies, and soybeans.
